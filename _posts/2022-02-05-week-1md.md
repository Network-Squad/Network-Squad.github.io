	mockups of the app before the beta version 
	budget depends on the app idea
	ask him about the budget he can afford
 
time structure 45 min: 
	5min to explain the main idea
	30min to understand it and calculate the budget ; and agree about smth
	10min questions 
outcams : 
	atlest 2k budget 

=================Production steps=======================
+ **steps to make the app** :  

	+ Generate an app idea
	+ Do competitive market research
	+ Write out the features for your app
	+ Make design mockups of your app
