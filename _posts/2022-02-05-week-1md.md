	budget depends on the app idea
	ask him about the budget he can afford
 
time structure 45 min: 
	5min to explain the main idea
	30min to understand it and calculate the budget ; and agree about smth
	10min questions 
expected outcoms : 
	atlest 2k budget 💰 (cost + labour time cost)

### Production steps

	+ Generate an app idea
	+ Do competitive market research
	+ Write out the features for your app
	+ Make design mockups of your app

	+ Put together an app marketing plan
	+ Build the app with one of these options
	+ Submit your app to the App Store
