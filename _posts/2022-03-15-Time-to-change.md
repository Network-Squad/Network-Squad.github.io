im ashamed of my self ; while im sitting here and typing this my foggy thoughts , i made mistakes , i feel like im giving up on my dreams , i just want to have fun doing absolotly nothing to do with my dream ; i want to be confotobale and happy ; but thats wrong ; im really afraid of taking risk and doing stuff ; cuz of that pain after u do shit ton of work and failled that feer of failling makes me delay my dream ; and just live as it is ; watching yt videos waisting shit ton of time ; ican see the vision but i should remmember that the fucking pain is fun ; confotbale its the real pain ; do pain stuff ; keep fucking trying dont ever quite ; enjoy that fucking pain ; cuz someone out there in this world choose the pain over confort and gain adventege over u ; pain not over until u acheive ur dream ; step ABZ ; the goal Z ; the first step A , the second step B < 

**be courage start over again**
im capable of runing a great bussnes from now ; but fear paralyze me
my fucking emotions are problem 

i shall use the weekends as adventage ; insted of resting 

it doesnt mater wt happen to me today but I CAN ACHEIVE MY DREAM . 



dreams without goals are just dreams


prepare for the examen 
keep failing and trying 

### Conclusion (should be updated)
