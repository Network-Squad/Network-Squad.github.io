Hi friends,

Did you learned somthing last week ? I traveled with ma familly and i was nervous asf ; meeting familly and i dont know how to talk propaly anyway i learned stuff along the way 

## Study - School üìö
How to use anki ? [fich write down the questions and answers in the other side and test ur self over time to memorize them]
How to enjoy study ? [use colores and techniqs and study group]
How to stay focused ? [pomodoro]
How to take care of school materials ? [group to study with and ]

I prepared a map full of topics that i will have at the exam , with some tips , but im still working on it , to eventely start before the end of this month

+ Everyday 2h (using pomodoro techniq) of revising school material of that day  
[the begining always hard ABZ]
